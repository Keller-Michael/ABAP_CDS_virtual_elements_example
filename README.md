# :cyclone: ABAP CDS with Virtual Elements Example

This is a very small prototype of a simple ABAP CDS, enhanced with virtual elements. The example was made on Business Technology Platform with a [free trial account](https://developers.sap.com/tutorials/hcp-create-trial-account.html) so it should be easy to work with it. I used some blogs like [this one](https://blogs.sap.com/2020/01/13/using-virtual-elements-with-cds-in-fiori-elements/) and [this one](https://blogs.sap.com/2022/10/06/how-to-use-virtual-elements-in-abap-restful-application-programming-model/) to create the example but I experienced some differences since ABAP CDS is now working with view entities.

Good starting points to explore the example are the by virtual elements enhanced [ABAP CDS](./src/zmke_c_demo_flight_enh.ddls.asddls) and the [ABAP class](./src/zcl_mke_virtual_elements.clas.abap) that contains the logic.
